Country-State-City database of the world. Free for all.

After spending two entire days trying to find a free database containing some really basic information of the world, **our world**, without much success, I got really tired of the situation and kind of outraged too, that something which **should** be free, isn't, and instead of asking for donations you have to buy their databases. Downright ridiculous!.

This project aims to give everyone out there a concise, easy-to-use country database for use in any kind of project without any limitations. It is, however, a crowd project, which means that if **you** find some incorrect information about your country, state or city, kindly please take a few minutes to correct it. It'll help both you and everyone out there looking for the same information you just found. Fair, don't you think? :)
